Project Description: Python Command-Line Calculator
Overview
This Python project is a simple command-line calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator is designed to take two numeric inputs from the user and allow them to choose the desired operation. It handles invalid inputs and division by zero errors gracefully.

Features
Addition: Adds two numbers.
Subtraction: Subtracts one number from another.
Multiplication: Multiplies two numbers.
Division: Divides one number by another, with error handling for division by zero.
User Interaction: Prompts the user for input and provides a menu of operations.
Input Validation: Ensures that only numeric values are entered and handles invalid operations.
How to Use
Run the Python script.
Enter the first number when prompted.
Enter the second number when prompted.
Choose the desired operation by entering the corresponding number (1 for addition, 2 for subtraction, 3 for multiplication, 4 for division).
View the result of the operation.
Decide if you want to perform another calculation or exit the program.
